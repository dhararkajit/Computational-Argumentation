              "First of all, I know that not EVERY person with right-wing or conservative/libertarian leanings is a homophobic racist, so if you want to come in just to say \"not me,\" then I got you.  \\n\\nWhat I seem to be talking about are the Republican men who assume they have the right to dictate things about the body of women, the Fox News anchors who bend over backwards to defend the police no matter what they did (as seen when they focused on the report absolving Darren Wilson while ignoring the report admitting huge racist bias in the Ferguson Police in general).  Really, most of this could be Fox News bullshit like insisting Jesus was white then crying \"satire\" when being rightfully scorned, or Chris Wallace calling Kelly Clarkson fat, or... almost every single thing Fox News does and every single subhumanite it employs.  The man-hours spent trying to come up with legal loopholes to discriminate against others, the denial of science and facts (odd for a party that once prided itself on being logical and intellectual).\\n\\nI'm not saying the Democrats or liberals are 100% right either, nobody is, it's just at least their party doesn't seem to have \"fucking over minorities\" as a priority.\\n\\nAnd even on just actual political issues, they seem to be wrong about giving Wall Street a wide berth, wrong about the tax breaks given to the wealthiest Americans, wrong about how much countries love us interfering in their business, wrong about the need to look for alternative sources of energy... in any issue I can almost always assume the right will be on the wrong side.\\n\\nEDIT:  Don't focus on my complaints on Fox News, I probably shouldn't have included them (although they are notoriously biased to the right).  I'm talking about the right's support for military intervention in the mideast, the subservience to big businesses, the reluctance to get involved in environmental concerns, the lionization of the Rush Limbaughs and Bill O'Reillys over, perhaps, the more moderate members of their own party like Jon Huntsman.\\n\\nEDIT:  http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/25/republicans-vow-to-fight-net-neutrality/ (this is dumb)\\n          http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/01/todd-gardenhire_n_6986582.html (this is dumb)\\n          http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/the-conservative-ambivalence-about-abuses-in-ferguson-department-of-justice-michael-brown/387196/ (where is it indeed?)\\n\\nEDIT:  I was pretty rant-y and ornery when I made this, but /u/vortexmagus basically made a better point for me, so he got a Delta.  Also, never said Democrats were perfect, and finally no one will ever convince me that the damage done to Darren Wilson's reputation is equal or greater than the so, so very many unarmed minorities killed by police.  Tamir Rice was 12.  John Crawford III was shot from behind holding a legal BB gun sold in Wal-Mart after some dumbass hick called 911, and nobody is being charged.  Seriously people, at least admit that there's a reason minorities have the perception of cops that they do.\\n_____\\n\\n>     I think most of your points are wrong, but the...\n",
